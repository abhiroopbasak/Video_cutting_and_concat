# Video Editing using Pyhton

## Cutting Video

The code is able to cut certain segments of the video with the given time frame using python automically. The main library used in this case is moviepy. This results into new files with a portion of the video

## Concatenation

The next step involves concatting two or more video elements into a single file. This might take a few while based on the GPU performance of the system, but once run, results a new file with the videos concatenated one after the other.
